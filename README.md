# PEAK

![Peak promo image](promo-image.png)

Peak is a largely superficial fork of [Glance](https://github.com/Rytiggy/Glance) by [Rytiggy](https://github.com/Rytiggy/Glance), and takes the form of a Fitbit clock face specializing in blood glucose monitoring. Take a peek at your peak (or, hopefully, a boring and level graph)!
