# PEAK

![Peak promo image](promo-image.png)

Tired of medical software looking so... medical? Peak is a fork of [Glance](https://github.com/Rytiggy/Glance) by [Rytiggy](https://github.com/Rytiggy/Glance) that's just about the looks. It's a Fitbit clockface that displays your blood glucose information from the cloud. Take a peek at your peak (or, hopefully, a boring and level graph)!

## Changes from Glance

➕&nbsp; Completely new, streamlined & minimal look

➕&nbsp; Additional date display options

➕&nbsp; Tapping the center of the display (the time and date area) toggles the visibility of the time and date

➕&nbsp; Tapping the glucose reading attempts a refresh, and what's that—a basic animation!?

➕&nbsp; Low battery icon only appears when device is at or below 15%

➕&nbsp; Improved UX of settings interface

## Features

###### Note: While the original [Glance](https://github.com/Rytiggy/Glance) works on a variety of Fitbit devices in and with various medical hardware, Peak has currently only been tested on a Fitbit Sense & Versa 3 with Dexcom. The below features, while technically present, likely need some adjustments
